## Exercise I

a) O(N³)
  * The loop will continue to run a number of times equal to N cubed.


b) O(N²)
  * Includes a nested loop that runs through each element for every interation of the outer loop


c) O(1)
  * The size of the input has no influence on the runtime of this function.
    No matter the size of the input, it will run at the same speed.
